## Project Title: EESA Club Webpage

Welcome to the EESA Club webpage for the ENTC department at [VIIT](https://www.viit.ac.in/) Pune! This webpage provides a platform for the EESA club to represent and showcase various events, registrations, and information related to the club.

## Project Overview 
This webpage provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for the EESA club to share information and updates with the students of the ENTC department at VIIT Pune. The webpage includes various pages such as [Home](src/Home.jsx), [About Us](src/AboutUs.jsx), [Events](src/Events.jsx), [Registrations](src/Registerpage.jsx),[Gallery](src/Gallery.jsx), [Committee](src/CoreCommittee.jsx), [Developers](src/Developers.jsx), [Join Us](src/JoinUs.jsx),[Sign Up](src/Signuppage.jsx) and [Heads](src/Head.jsx).

## Description:
This project is a simple demonstration of how to use [React](https://reactjs.org/), a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, in conjunction with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a blazing fast frontend build tool, on [Repl.it.](https://replit.com/~) The project includes a basic React component that displays a greeting message, which can be edited in real-time and viewed using the live update feature provided by Vite.

## Getting Started:
To get started, simply hit the `Run` button to launch the development server. The server will automatically open a new tab in your web browser, where you can view and interact with the running application.

To make changes to the application, edit the [Home.jsx](#src/Home.jsx) file located in the src directory. The development server will automatically reload the page with your changes, allowing you to see the results of your modifications in real-time.

## Prerequisites and Dependencies

- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.)
- Internet connection

## Script Commands

  Document all script commands used for development, testing, and deployment in your [package.json](package.json) file.
  
## Installation Instructions 
[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

## Configuration Settings 
By default, Replit runs the `dev` script provided by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). However, you can configure it by changing the run field in the [configuration file](#.replit). Here are the [Vite docs](https://vitejs.dev/) for [serving production websites](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html).

## Typescript:
To use Typescript in this project, simply rename any file from `.jsx` to `.tsx.` You can also try our [TypeScript Template](https://replit.com/@replit/React-TypeScript) for a more comprehensive setup.
